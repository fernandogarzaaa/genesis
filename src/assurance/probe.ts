/**
 * Probes: the adversarial inputs an audit fires at a verifier.
 *
 * A probe pairs a task with a candidate completion and states what a *correct*
 * verifier must do with it. Two kinds, and both are mandatory:
 *
 *   - **exploit probes** (`expect: "reject"`) — a completion that satisfies the
 *     defect but not the task. A verifier that accepts one has the defect.
 *   - **control probes** (`expect: "accept"`) — a genuinely correct completion.
 *
 * Controls are not optional garnish. Without them a verifier that rejects
 * everything scores a perfect zero false-accept rate while being useless. This
 * is the same tension the acceptance layer met as coverage-versus-false-ship,
 * and it has the same resolution: report both rates, never one.
 *
 * A suite is content-addressed. An audit result is meaningless unless it names
 * which probes produced it, so the suite digest is recorded with every finding.
