/**
 * Audit findings and metrics. Pure — no I/O, no clock, no randomness.
 *
 * Same discipline as the acceptance layer's adjudicator, for the same reason:
 * an audit conclusion that cannot be recomputed from its recorded probe results
 * is not auditable, and an assurance tool that is not itself auditable is a
 * joke. `tests/assurance.purity.test.ts` enforces it.
 *
 * Reuses `wilson` from the backtest module. Per-class probe counts are small —
 * often two or three — so a bare point estimate would be actively misleading,
 * and the interval is not decoration.
